#Travel-Budz
Project 4 React on Rails

#MVP
 
 The MVP for my application is a travel board where users can create trips and other users have the ability to join the trip resulting in social group travel experience. Users will also be able to view all trips created by others and comment on them or ask general questions about upcoming trips. Users will have a general profile which will detail their information as well as a list of trips they have created or joined.

#REACH GOALS

 Some other features I would like to integrate into my application is the abilty for users to perform a flight search and get current available flights between their destinations which would return flight dates, times, airline, cabin type, flight numbers, duration of flights, and airline name.
 Also I would like users to have a calender view which would plot their trips they have joined.
